### To Do
- [x] Jest vs Cypress
- [x] Install and Configure Cypress
- [x] Design End-to-End Tests with Cypress

### Jest v Cypress
* Jest
  * purely on command line
  * great for unit testing
* Cypress
  * sits outside our app
  * it can be used to test any application
  * all tests run in a browser
  * take a looooong time
  * we are testing the app the same way the user does
  * e2e testing === user stories
