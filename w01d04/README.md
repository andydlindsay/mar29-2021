# W01D04 - Callbacks!

### To Do
- [x] Functions as values
- [x] Callbacks and higher order functions
- [x] Function calling vs function passing
- [x] Anonymous functions
- [x] Arrow functions
- [x] Make our own higher order function


### Callback
* A function that we pass to another function to be invoked by that function
* First class function

### Higher Order Function
* The function that accepts another function as an argument

### Advantages of Arrow Functions
1. Shorter syntax
2. The latest thing in terms of functions
3. If there's only one argument, we can eliminate the ()
4. If there's only one line of code, you can eliminate the {}
5. If there's no {}, we get an implicit `return` for free

### Higher Order Functions
* Array methods: forEach, map, filter, reduce
